{{define "PlainBody"}}
Hi,

You have requested a password reset for your Books and More Community account.

Your user ID is {{.userID}}. To proceed with resetting your password, send a 
request to `PUT /api/v1/users/password` endpoint with the following JSON body before 
the expiery deadline.

{"token":"{{.passwordResetToken}}", "newPassword":"NEW_PASSWORD_VALUE"}

This token is valid until {{.tokenExpiryTime}}. If you did not request this reset, 
you can ignore this email, and your password will remain unchanged.

Thanks,

The Booke and More Community Team
